##  Position [來源](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)
- Specify the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).


### 1. static (default.)
- The position cannot be adjusted.
- 
### 2. relative
- Relative to its normal position.
- Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties. 
```
position: relative;
left: 20px;
```

### 3. fixed
- Stays in the **same place** even if the page is scrolled. 

### 4. absolute
- positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

### 5. sticky
- toggles between **relative** and **fixed**, depending on the scroll position.
