# @media 
- used in **media queries** to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

## Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
- resolution

Use media queries to specify that certain styles are only for printed documents or for screen readers (mediatype: print, screen, or speech).

# max-width property 
- Defines the maximum width of an element.
- Prevents the value of the width property from becoming larger than max-width.
- If the content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the height of the element.
