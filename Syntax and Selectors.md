# CSS Selectors
- select the HTML element(s) you want to style.

## Five categories of CSS selectors:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on **name, id, class**)
- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

### by name (p, a, ...)
```css
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```
### by id (#)
```css
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

<p id="para1">Hello World!</p>
```

### by class (.)
```css
.center {
